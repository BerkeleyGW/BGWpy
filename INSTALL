Installing
----------

Automatic installation:

    python -m pip install BGWpy

Manual installation: once you have satisfied the requirements, install the package with

    python setup.py install

Whether you install automatically of manually,
you should run the script `BGWpy_make_config_file.py`
to generate a runtime configuration file `~/.BGWpyrc`
which you can then modify. Most options in this file
represent default values, and can be overridden when using the module.

Installation
------------

Once you have satisfied the requirements listed in README.rst, issue

  python setup.py build

  python setup.py install

You may then run the script `BGWpy_make_config_file.py`
to generate a runtime configuration file `~/.BGWpyrc`
which you can modify. Most options in this file
represent default values, and can be overridden when using the module.

A python module to operate BerkeleyGW


Documentation
-------------

We recommend learning the basic usage from the examples provided
with the source distribution in ~BGWpy/Examples/. The docstrings
of the various objects also contain information and can be accessed
from a python interpreter with

    help(BGWpy.<object>)


or from ipython with

    In  [1]: BGWpy.<object>?


Requirements
------------

The following software and modules are required to use BGWpy.

  * python 3 and python 2 compatible
  * numpy 1.6+      (http://www.scipy.org/)
  * pymatgen 4.0+   (http://pymatgen.org/)
  * BerkeleyGW 1.2+ (http://www.berkeleygw.org/)

Note that the binary executables of BerkeleyGW must be found
in your PATH environment variable.


Installing
----------

Automatic installation:

    python -m pip install BGWpy

Manual installation: once you have satisfied the requirements, install the package with

    python setup.py install

Whether you install automatically of manually,
you should run the script `BGWpy_make_config_file.py`
to generate a runtime configuration file `~/.BGWpyrc`
which you can then modify. Most options in this file
represent default values, and can be overridden when using the module.

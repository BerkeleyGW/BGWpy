 Writing DEN file:
Reading header of density file
 Inconsistency found in the following input parameters
 List of stored \& read values:
nkpt         4 /=      4
nband        9 /=      5
 There may be a difference in kpoints/bands in the DEN/WFK calculations
 Assuming an experienced user, the calculation will continue
